# Surf-Shop
Welcome Guys! This repo consists of my code for Surf-Shop from Ian's Code with Node course. In the course, Ian taught us the complete back-end part, but due to some reasons, he was unable to do the front-end. So, me and my friend [Elemento](https://github.com/Elemento24), did the front-end part.  

We have deployed the website on Heroku, and you can check it using the following link...
